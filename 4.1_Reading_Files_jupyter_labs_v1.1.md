<h2 align=center>Reading Text Files</h2>

One way to read or write a file in Python is to use the built-in **open** function. The **open** function provides a **File object** that contains the methods and attributes you need in order to read, save, and manipulate the file. In this notebook, we will only cover **.txt** files. The first parameter you need is the file path and the file name. An example is shown in __Figure 1__:

  <h4 align=center>  
    Figure 1: Labeled Syntax of a file object.  

  </h4> 

 The mode argument is optional and the default value is **r**. In this notebook we only cover two modes: 

<li>**r** Read mode for reading files </li>
<li>**w** Write mode for writing files</li>

 For the next example, we will use the text file **Example1.txt**. The file is shown in figure 2:


 <a ><img src = "https://ibm.box.com/shared/static/ilzy3av6x1cd3gi61bq2nq0vxb0awhju.png" width = 200, align = "center"></a>
  <h4 align=center>  
    Figure 2: The text file "Example1.txt".

  </h4> 

 We read the file: 


```python
example1="/resources/data/Example1.txt"
file1 = open(example1,"r")
```

 We can view the attributes of the file.

The name of the file:


```python
file1.name
```




    '/resources/data/Example1.txt'



 The mode the file object is in:


```python
file1.mode
```




    'r'



We can read the file and assign it to a variable :


```python
FileContent=file1.read()
FileContent
```




    'This is line 1 \nThis is line 2\nThis is line 3'



The “/n” means that there is a new line. 

We can print the file: 


```python
print(FileContent)
```

    This is line 1 
    This is line 2
    This is line 3


The file is of type string:


```python
type(FileContent)
```




    str



 We must close the file object:


```python
file1.close()
```

 <h3> A  Better Way to Open a File </h3>

Using the **with** statement is better practice, it automatically closes the file even if the code encounters an exception. The code will run everything in the indent block then close the file object. 



```python
with open(example1,"r") as file1:
    FileContent=file1.read()
    print(FileContent)
```

    This is line 1 
    This is line 2
    This is line 3


The file object is closed, you can verify it by running the following cell:  


```python
file1.closed
```




    True



 We can see the info in the file:


```python
print(FileContent)
```

    This is line 1 
    This is line 2
    This is line 3


The syntax is a little confusing as the file object is after the **as** statement. We also don’t explicitly close the file. Therefore we summarise the steps in a figure:

 <a ><img src = "https://ibm.box.com/shared/static/ywul1ji1ld82xwz60ljxvbg6fs2vrunm.png" width = 500, align = "center"></a>
  <h4 align=center>  
    The syntax for opening a file using a 'with' statement.

  </h4> 


```python
with open(example1,"r") as file1:
    FileContent=file1.readlines()
    print(FileContent)
```

    ['This is line 1 \n', 'This is line 2\n', 'This is line 3']


We don’t have to read the entire file, for example, we can read the first 4 characters by entering three as a parameter to the method **.read()**:



```python
with open(example1,"r") as file1:
    print(file1.read(4))
```

    This


Once the method **.read(4)** is called the first 4 characters are called.  If we call the method again, the next 4 characters are called. The output for the following cell will demonstrate the process for different inputs to the method **read() **:




```python
with open(example1,"r") as file1:
    print(file1.read(4))
    print(file1.read(4))
    print(file1.read(7))
    print(file1.read(15))

```

    This
     is 
    line 1 
    
    This is line 2


 The process is illustrated in the below figure, and each colour represents the part of the file read after the method **read()** is called:

  <h4 align=center>  
     Illustration using the method **.read()** to call different characters 

  </h4> 

 Here is an example using the same file, but instead we read 16, 5, and then 9 characters at a time: 


```python
with open(example1,"r") as file1:
    print(file1.read(16))
    print(file1.read(5))
    print(file1.read(9))

```

    This is line 1 
    
    This 
    is line 2


We can also read one line of the file at a time using the method **readline()**: 


```python
 with open(example1,"r") as file1:
    print("first line: " + file1.readline())

```

    first line: This is line 1 
    


 We can use a loop to iterate through each line: 



```python
 with open(example1,"r") as file1:
        i=0;
        for line in file1:
            print("Iteration" ,str(i),":",line)
            i=i+1;
```

    Iteration 0 : This is line 1 
    
    Iteration 1 : This is line 2
    
    Iteration 2 : This is line 3


We can use the method **readline()** to save the text file to a list: 


```python
with open(example1,"r") as file1:
    FileasList=file1.readlines()
```

 Each element of the list corresponds to a line of text:


```python
FileasList[0]
```




    'This is line 1 \n'




```python
FileasList[1]
```




    'This is line 2\n'




```python
FileasList[2]
```




    'This is line 3'
